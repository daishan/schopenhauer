<h1>BARENAKED LADIES - BIG BANG THEORY THEME</h1>

<p>Der Satz vom Grunde beschreibt unterschiedliche Relationsbeziehungen zwischen verschiedenen
    Objekten und legt damit einen Grundstein für alle Beweisbarkeit. Alle Wissenschaften, die sich die
    Menschheit im Laufe der Zeit erarbeitet hat, bauen demnach auf ihm auf.<br>

    Barenaked Ladies beschreiben in ihrem Song über den Urknall genau solche Relationsbeziehungen
    zwischen den Dingen der Welt und die damit einhergehende Forschungsarbeit auf
    unterschiedlichsten Gebieten – von Religion und Mythologie, über Physik bis hin zur Astrologie.</p>

<p class="lyrics">Our whole universe was in a hot dense state,
    Then nearly fourteen billion years ago expansion started. Wait...
    The Earth began to cool,
    The autotrophs began to drool,
    Neanderthals developed tools,
    We built a wall (we built the pyramids),
    Math, science, history, unraveling the mysteries,
    That all started with the big bang!</p>

<p class="lyrics">"Since the dawn of man" is really not that long,
    As every galaxy was formed in less time than it takes to sing this song.
    A fraction of a second and the elements were made.
    The bipeds stood up straight,
    The dinosaurs all met their fate,
    They tried to leap but they were late
    And they all died – they froze their asses off
    The oceans and Pangea
    See ya, wouldn't wanna be ya
    Set in motion by the same big bang!</p>

<p class="lyrics">It all started with the big bang!</p>

<p class="lyrics">It's expanding ever outward but one day
    It will cause the stars to go the other way,
    Collapsing ever inward, we won't be here, it won't be heard
    Our best and brightest figure that it'll make an even bigger bang!</p>

<p class="lyrics">Australopithecus would really have been sick of us
    Debating how we're here, they're catching deer (we're catching viruses)
    Religion or astronomy, Encarta, Deuteronomy
    It all started with the big bang!</p>

<p class="lyrics">Music and mythology, Einstein and astrology
    It all started with the big bang!
    It all started with the big bang!</p>
